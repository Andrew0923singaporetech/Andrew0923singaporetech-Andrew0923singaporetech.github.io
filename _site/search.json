    "title": "Final Year Project: Smart Obstacle Avoiding Robot",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The purpose of our project is to create a Smart Obstacle Avoiding Robot which can be given instructions to move to specific locations. This robot will be able to detect its 2D surroundings and capture images from the front view. The system is designed to be autonomous, with sensors enabling obstacle detection and a camera for capturing images.\n\n\n\nIn the realm of robotics, one significant challenge is ensuring that robots can navigate autonomously while avoiding obstacles in real-time. This project aims to solve this problem by developing a robot capable of moving through a space while avoiding obstacles and capturing images to analyze its surroundings.\n\n\n\nThe project involves the use of various technologies and tools, including: - Single Board Computer: Raspberry Pi - Robot Operating System (ROS): An open-source robotics middleware suite - Operating System: Ubuntu MATE for Raspberry Pi - Design Software: Designspark to design the robot base and gear motor holder - Components: Motors, sensors, and cameras for obstacle detection and image capturing\n\n\n\nThe project involves designing and building the robot base from scratch. Key aspects include: - Robot Base: The design and selection of materials that provide stability and support for the robot’s sensors and motor system. - Motor and Gear Holder: Using the appropriate motor holders to ensure movement precision. - Sensor Integration: Integrating sensors that will allow the robot to detect obstacles and navigate through spaces. - Camera for Image Capture: A front-facing camera to capture and process images, helping the robot understand its environment.\n \n\n\n\nI was involved in the following aspects of the project: - System Integration: Working with the team to integrate ROS with Raspberry Pi and the sensors. - Robot Base Design: Contributing to the design of the robot base, selecting materials, and ensuring stability. - Obstacle Avoidance Algorithm: Implementing the obstacle avoidance logic using sensor data.\n\n\n\nDuring the project, several challenges arose, including: - Challenge 1: Sensor Calibration: The sensors initially provided inaccurate data for obstacle detection. This was solved by calibrating the sensors and optimizing the code. - Challenge 2: Motor Control: Controlling the motors in a precise manner for accurate movement was tricky. This was addressed by fine-tuning the motor drivers and implementing smoother control algorithms.\n\n\n\nThe project resulted in the following outcomes: - A fully functional robot capable of autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance. - Integration of a camera system that allows the robot to capture images of its surroundings. - A report detailing the entire process, from design to implementation.\n\n\n\nYou can view the project code and demo via the following links: - GitHub Repository (Code) - Project Demo Video (Live Demo or Video)\n\n\n\nThis project provided valuable experience in working with robotics technologies and designing an autonomous system. The lessons learned about system integration, sensor calibration, and motor control have enhanced my problem-solving skills. I’m proud of the work completed and excited about its potential in real-world applications.\n\n\n\nI would like to thank [Your Mentor or Team Members] for their guidance and contributions throughout this project."
